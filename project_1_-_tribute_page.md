# Project 1 - Tribute Page

First project will be created using Codepen ([codepen.io](http://codpen.io)). The purpose of this project is to create a tribute page satisfying the following conditions:

* 
Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/NNvBQW/.

* 
Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

* 
Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries you need. Give it your own personal style.

* 
User Story: I can view a tribute page with an image and text.

* 
User Story: I can click on a link that will take me to an external website with further information on the topic.

* 
Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.

* 
When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.

* 
You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.

Note: In order to open the link in new tab you need to use ```target``` attribute on anchor elements:
```<a href="http://wikipedia.org" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>```
Otherwise links won't be operational since codepen is not following links for security reason.
