Bootstrap has its own `<button>` element.
* `btn` class makes it as wide as the text it displays

```
<button class="btn">Like</button>
```
* `btn-block` class will make it stretch the width of whole page; it still needs `btn` class

```
<button class="btn btn-block">Submit</button>
```
* The `btn-primary` class is the main color you'll use in your app. 
```
<button class="btn btn-block btn-primary">Like</button>
```
* buttons can have pre-defined colors for actions; `btn-info` , `btn-danger`
```
<button class="btn btn-block btn-info">Info</button>
```
